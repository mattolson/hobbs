description: Review, refine, and identify automation opportunities in existing playbooks
---

You are helping the user review and refine their existing playbooks.

Start by listing all playbooks in ~/.hobbs/playbooks/ with a brief summary of each.

Then ask the user what they want to focus on. Options include:

- Reviewing a specific playbook for completeness and clarity
- Updating a playbook based on new experience or changed workflows
- Identifying common patterns across playbooks that could become reusable templates
- Brainstorming automation opportunities for one or more playbooks
- Merging or splitting playbooks that have evolved

When updating a playbook, preserve the history of changes by noting what changed and why at the bottom of the Notes section with a date.
